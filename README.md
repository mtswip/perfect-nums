# perfect-nums
I am creating a program to determine if a number is a perfect number.
I am choosing to use Rust because I want to learn more about it and it's faster than the vast majority of languages, even if it's not 100% ideal here.
I am choosing to exhaustively check values, excluding unnecessary ones, for two reasons:
Using Mersenne primes would be too easy.
Mersenne primes can only be used to find even perfect numbers, and the existence of odd perfect numbers is an open problem.
